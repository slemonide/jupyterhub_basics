Backups volumes to `/data/jypyterhub/backup/restic/mnt/restic/` at the start of every hour.

Restic basically works like git.

To work with it, first get inside its container, `docker-compose exec restic bash`.

Then, to chech snapshots: `restic -r /mnt/restic/ snapshots`
Snapshots are basically like commits in git, but opposite to commits, snapshots can be
empty. I.e. we will always get a new snapshot recorc every time we make a snaphsot, even
if there is no new data added.

To restore a snapshot with id \<snapshot-id\>, use `restic -r /mnt/restic/ restore <snapshot-id> --target /`.
It's fairly easy to restore to previous snapshot, and then get back to current version as well. Just like git.

Restic can also restore particular file/directory as opposed to rollbacking the whole system.
